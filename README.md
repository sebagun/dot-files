dot-files
=========

Configuration files for many applications I use, under a unix environment. Also some specific tweaks for OS X and Cocoa.

Installation
------------

```
git clone git@github.com:sebagun/dot-files.git  
cd dot-files  
./install.sh  
```

**NOTES:**

- The installation script will replace any of these files already present in your home directory, so be aware of it and backup useful files/configurations.

- DON'T use this `gitconfig` file as it is now. You'll want to open it up and replace my name and email address with your own. Otherwise, I'll get all the credit for your work.

That's all folks!
