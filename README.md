dot-files
=========

Configuration files for many applications I use, under a unix environment.

Installation
------------

git clone git@github.com:sebagun/dot-files.git

cd dot-files

./install

That's all folks!

**NOTE:** the installation script will replace any of these files already present in your home directory, so be aware of it and backup useful files/configurations.
